title: Gneiss
---
Gneiss has two locations, OG banks and Hill security. Both locations are very well maintained and have new sets every week! Gneiss tends to be mostly competition style bouldering, but there's always lots of variety. Hill security often hosts events such as climbing competitions and community gatherings/parties.
