description: Kelowna rock climbing is often overshadowed by the infamous Skaha
  bluffs, but deserves much more recognition. Kelowna offers walls with wicked
  jugs, in-cut crimps, textured slopers, pockets, huecos and more. Each climbing
  location in Kelowna offers completely different styles and scenery. Come touch
  our rocks!

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
